## Evaluation for YouTube Shorts Pipeline

For YouTube Shorts scripts, Rytr appears to be the better option due to:
1. Specialization in short-form content
2. Pre-designed templates that can help structure engaging short videos
3. More affordable pricing
4. Better suited for marketing/promotional content typical of YouTube Shorts

Sudowrite could be useful if the YouTube Shorts have a strong narrative or storytelling component, but its focus on fiction makes it less versatile for general short-form video content.
